0.50 - 2/15/2007
	   Created the version.txt file so all changes before 0.48 are unknown
	     Added a C8_VERSION define at the top of crazy8.cpp it will need to be
	     incrimented at every change and this file will need to be updated.
	   Added the current version to the title screen.
	   Fixed the bug with addcard command
	   	the first argument of all functions is the function name so it was
	   	passing the following to the get_card_with_abv function
	   	"<function_name> <abv_name>" this was fixed to "<abv_name>"
	   Fixed bug with playing an 8
	   	it would crash because the bank was not declared external in the 
	   	cmd.cpp file
	   Change over to multiple files instead of one large file
	   All of the bug fixes involved in the conversion
	   High score system html and text output files
			only the text version can be used as an input file
0.49 - 2/14/2007
	   Changes to the ncolor.cpp color library html print function
	   	it now converts newlines ('\n') tabs ('\t') and space (' ') to the proper
		html characters
		* there is a bug with some of the colors still not rendering right after
		  the addition of character replacement for whitespace.
